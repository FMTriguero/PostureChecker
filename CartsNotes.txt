Starting the project off by cloning the repo at: https://github.com/FMTriguero/PostureChecker.git

Now I will make a branch of the project and name it "Carts-Start-Branch", then I switched to that branch to start working.

First things I want to do is install Tensorflow, keras, numpy.

I have noticed that the Pipfile has python3.9 as the current version but it needs to be 3.8 becuase tensorflow does not have a stable verison for py3.9 

"pipenv --python 3.8" switches to python3.8 in my virtual env.

Ran "pipenv install tensorflow"

no issues, but the pipenv said there were dependency issues. though, when I ran python I did not get any errors!

-------10:24pm
Now I will also install pytest.. No error

-------11:21pm
being that i do not have a way for someone to film my posture, I will be testing the first model out with my hand (thumbs up, thumbs down).

The images are crude. but this is fine becuase all I am doing is trying to import the model and get it working in my project.

The test code from the teachable machine site has a single photo top be opened, I will take a photo, put it into the .gitignore and process the image.

------11:52pm
I got the code to work but I had to do a few things.
1. extract the keras_model.h5 and put it into the .gitignore folder
2. Took a photo of my thumbs up
3. Added absolute paths to the location of the model and test image (both in the .gitignore).

Before I close out I will mod the output of the model. The model send a list with a tuple of 2 values (actually n values relative to the number of classes).
0-Thumbs up
1-Thumbs down

All I am going to add is "if position[0][0] > position[0][1]: output.".

I am also going to said a main, call the model function and then return the prediction.

All good. Good night
